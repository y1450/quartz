>[👨🏻‍🌾 Bob]
>So you want to learn the art of [🌳 Digital Gardening]? We'll you've come to the right place - here in my [🪴 Grow Room](-grow-room.md) you can see some seeds that have already been planted.
>First of all, lets get you thinking about what you want to grow!

## 🌱 What is a Seed?

A 🌱 seed in the [🌳 Digital Garden] is any kind of document you create that contains ideas, thoughts, resources and other collected things.

When you create a new document it goes into the **🌱 Seed Box** folder - an inbox of unsorted items that you collect during the day. Don't be afraid to fill it up the aim is to let you just capture your stream of thoughts - but it's important that you triage regularly.

There are a list of [] below - when a new seed is created it appears in the [🪴 Grow Room](-grow-room.md) (along with **🪵 Backlog** items).

To create a new file from a template - use the [Command Pallete] and select `Templater: Create new note from template` (or **⌘ + ⌥ + n** on OSX).

## 💡 Planting Seeds (Triage)

When an item is in the 🌱 Seed Box it has a `status::` property set to `#triage`.  The first thing to do is to select where it goes:

- Use the **🪵 Backlog** folder as a place where you have items you want to deal with in a short amount of time, but don't yet want to categorise.
- Place the file with in a [🗂 Project folder] for files related to a particular topic you are researching
- If it's a [⏣ Templates/👤 New Person], [⏣ Templates/🪛 Todo List] or [⏣ Templates/🔖 New Term] you can place them in the dedicated folders

When you remove it, update the `status::` field - see [⚠️ Statuses] on how to use this to help drive [🎯 Custom Dashboards].

## ⏣ Seed Templates

[🪨  🌳 Obsidian Garden] comes with a set of templates designed to let you capture different idea formats, from collecting a [⏣ Templates/📙 New Reading Item] such as a book or blog, collecting contacts with a [⏣ Templates/👤 New Person] or a [⏣ Templates/🪛 Todo List].

To create your own custom seed templates see the [🗂 Obsidian File Structure]

```dataview
table description as "Description"
from "⏣ Templates"
sort file.name ASC
```
