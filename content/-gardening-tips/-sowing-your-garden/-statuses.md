## The Status Property

In every ⏣ Template file there is a `Status::` property after the [frontmatter] block. 

There is no hard-and-fast rules on how to use this - the way it's implemented in the [👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/🪨  🌳  Obsidian Garden] is just a suggestion to show how it can be used to [🎯 Create Custom Dashboards].

There are 4 default statuses provided:

| Status         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `#triage`      | Set when a new file is created in the 🌱 Seed Box - The file can be empty with just a title, or a full blown article idea but at this point it has not yet be currated.                                                                                                                                   |
| `#ready`       | Set time aside to curate the 🌱 Seed Box, when you have dealt with the file you can set it to `#ready` and put it in either your 🪵 Backlog, or a 🗂 Project folder.                                                                                                                                       |
| `#in-progress` | This file is current and active, for whatever reason you decide - if it's a [⏰ ToDo Lists](-todo-lists.md) it could mean you have started some tasks, for a [⏣ Templates/📙 New Reading Item] it could be your active book.  For a [⏣ Templates/🔬 New Research] it could be you are activly gathering information. |
| `#done`        | The file in it's current state is done - this doesn't have to mean this file won't ever change, but rather it represents a state that you are happy it no longer needs your attention                                                                                                                     |

Now, you can build up queries like finding all `#ready` items to pick up, or see what you have `#in-progress` .

As statuses are just tags, feel free to use your own - just be aware this may mean they do not show up in some default views.
