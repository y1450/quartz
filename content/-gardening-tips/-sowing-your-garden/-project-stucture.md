## Projects all the way down
Inside Projects, use it as a normal folder stucture to organise your content - each project can represent something like a website, book, or other project where you need to collect data.

Inside each folder you can replecate some of the garden stucture - create your own sub [⏰ ToDo Lists](-todo-lists.md) or [👨‍👧‍👦 People](-people.md) page using tagging and properties to make it more specific.
