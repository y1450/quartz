## Welcome to your 🪴 Grow Room

The 🪴 Grow Room is your inbox on current 🪵 Backlog items, and [🌱 Seeds] you have created but not yet curated.

⚠️ Don't let your 🪵 Backlog or 🌱 Seed Box get too full!  Try and curate them daily so that there is room for more ideas to be planted

When you are in a creative flow, use [links] and [👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/🪴 Sowing Your Garden/🏷 Using Tags] in all the new files you create - clicking on links will create more seeds! This will create the [connections] across your [Knowledge Management] system.

Using the [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) plugin you can use the command palette to change from a [⏣ Templates/🗒 Basic Note] to any other type - such as [⏣ Templates/📙 New Reading Item].

If you are not ready to place the file, or have a file that can be deleted after use (like a shopping list) you can place it in the 🪵 Backlog - this is another inbox for files that are ready to be dealt with.

from "🌱 Seed Box"
sort file.ctime ASC
limit 5
```

## 🌱 Seed Box - All Items
