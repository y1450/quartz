## 📇 Glossary of Terms

This is a collected glossary of items with the `#term` tag.  You can use the [⏣ Templates/🔖 New Term] template, or add it to any existing note.

Terms can be anything from a concept to the name of something - for example in our terms folder we have [Link], [Connection], [Knowledge Management] and [Obsidian].

They allow us to add extra richness to our searches, discover alternative meanings and expand our vocabulary.

The page will automatically build a list of alphabetically-sorted terms - you can also [link] to this page to create a graph connection.

```dataview
table 
	category as "Category", 
	tags as "Tags", 
	length(file.inlinks) as "In Links", 
	length(file.outlinks) as "Out Links"
from #term 
where file.name != "🔖 New Term"
sort file.name ASC
```
