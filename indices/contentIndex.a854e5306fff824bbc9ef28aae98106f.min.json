There - I have to water almost daily, tend to the weeds, prune and support crops like tomatoes and peas, and generally nurture and tend to the space.\n\nThe process usually begins in spring when you sow your crops - either from seeds or cutting. At this stage most of your time and energy is something that will take time to see results.  It's a slow process - but as you tend to them gradually seedlings appear that can be planted in a new location.\n\nOnce planted, each crop requires specific tending needs - but all require water, nourishment and protection from slugs, bugs and insects.  Done well - by the end of summer you will be have been rewarded with a rich harvest of fruits and vegetables.\n\nWith the [🌳 Digital Garden] we want to achieve the same, but with great ideas as the bounty.\n\n### 🧑🏻‍💻 Becoming a Knowledge Gardener\n[🧑🏻‍💻 I've] tried several systems and invented a few myself (ask most people with ADHD - they'll have done the same). For me nothing has ever stuck - I even tried [🪨 Obsidian] before - but previously found it's UI difficult and there wasn't much clear documentation.\n\nAfter more recently discussing note taking apps I decided to give it a try again - I watched [👨‍👧‍👦 People/👤 Alexis Rondeau]'s video [How to use Obsidian to write a book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP4AeGY2mz4) - after this something just *clicked*.  \n\nWithin hours I already had things close to how I liked it. Within 24 hours I was creating a working system based on the garden idea, and digging into how Obsidian with [👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/🪨 Obsidian/🔌 Plugins] worked.\n\nThis guide is my collection of the discoveries I've made in doing this, with the hope that what I share can help on you on your way to becoming a knowledge gardener\n\n## Principles\n\n### Rich Templates and Content\n[👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/🪴 Sowing Your Garden/⚠️ Statuses]\n\nEach template file contains a set of [Front Matter] properties, the most important being `status`.  The defaults for the field are sensible: `triage`, `ready`, `in progress` and `done`.  Using these allows queries to be generated that show a particular status.  The field is customisable, and there are more properties available in each template - so feel free to use your own to build more complex query sets.\n\n### Query-driven pages\n[👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/🪴 Sowing Your Garden/🎯  Create Custom Dashboards]\n\nQuery-driven pages live at the top level of the garden, for example [📚 Reading](-reading.md) and [👨‍👧‍👦 People](-people.md), as well as the [👩‍🌾 Your Knowledge Garden](-your-knowledge-garden.md) file. These allow quick access to pages that let you see the underlying data in your files.","lastmodified":"2022-07-02T12:11:47.396632344Z","tags":null},"/-gardening-tips/-obsidian/-obsidian-file-struture":{"title":"🗂 Obsidian File Struture","content":"%%\nStatus:: #in-progress \n%%\n\n---\nTags:: #tutorial #obsidian #templates #markdown #front-matter #guide\nLinks:: [👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/🪴 Sowing Your Garden/🌱 Planting Seeds], [🎯 Create Custom Dashboards]\n\n---\n\n#  Tips on structuring your files\n\nIn [Obsidian] you use basic [Markdown] to create your content. Obsidian  adds  additional features such as the ability to [link], as well as a [Obsidian Query Language] and template tags.\n\nFor your garden to grow, it's good to make sure you have good file hygiene - these are some tips and tricks to help you get the most out of your knowledge.\n\n## Example File Structure\n\nThe description of this example file structure is below, but shows what a basic file can look like\n\n```\n---\naliases: [Example, example page]\ntype: example\ndescription: A description for the example page\n---\n%%\nStatus:: #triage\n%%\n\n---\n**Tags**:: #example #tutorial \n**Links**:: [🗂 Obsidian File Struture]\n\n---\n\n# Title\n\nPut some text and [Links] in your intro\n\n## Subtitle\n\nAdd some **extra** info that is *useful*\n```\n\n## Front Matter\n\nThe first thing in any [Markdown] file is it's [Front Matter] properties.  The most basic property required is `type` - this defines what type of content is it, and should come from the template.  You can also add an optional `description`.\n\nThe `aliases` property is used by [Obsidian] to generate [link] aliases, this means you can use different words on [links] but create the same connections.\n\nFront Matter properties are best use for ones where you don't want the user to change them, or they are pre-calculated such as a fixed date.  If you want more dynamic or user editable properties, it's better to use variables\n\n## Inline Variables\n\nProperties and variables added to a file allows for richer metadata queries using the [Obsidian Query Language], and can be used via plugins to enable features.\n\nWhile you can add variables to [Front Matter], you can also provide more dynamic ones as inline variables in documents.\n\nThe format is `Variable::` - Any text after this on the same line will be used as the value and can be used in table displays like the [📇 Glossary](-glossary.md)\n\n- Properties and variables can be added with [Front Matter]. This plugin allows[YAML] properties to the added top of your page between a block made up of 3 dashes (`---`).\n- Via variables on the page with the double colon notation (`Variable::`) - when placing these either consider putting them inside a `%%` comment block to hide them, or make their labels bold (`**Variable**::`). Use these for more volatile values like a status, or viewable values like a book author.\n\n## Creating Aliases\n\nIn the [frontmatter] properties, as the first one you can add the `aliases` property which is an array containing alternative names for the files - when creating links, you can use these alternative names to shorten the display of the links, including the same as the file name.\n\n## Good File Hygiene\n\n- Use [Front Matter] properties for items that you don't want the user to change very often, such as the file type\n- Hide Metadata variables in `%%` comment blocks, these can then still be used in queries but won't display in preview mode\n- Give inline variable labels a bold (`**`) formatting to stand out\n- Use a line break (`---` block in [Markdown]]] to show your metadata in an enclosed area\n\n### Example\n\n\n## Creating An Outline\n\nThe way to navigate within a file itself is by using an outline using [Markdown] headers tags.  The format is the hash (`#`) symbol between 1-6 times depending on the level, followed by a space and then your header - outlines can be viewed in the Outline [Sidebar] tab (by default on the right)\n\n\u003e When displaying on Obsidian Publishing the page title is already considered Level-1, so you should start your outline from Level 2 (`##`) if you intend to display a vault\n\n### Example\n\n```\n# Page Title\n## Sub Title\n### Group Title\n#### Section Title\n##### Level 5\n###### Level 6\n```\n\n## Using Variables and Templates\n\n[Obsidian] allows for rich pages to be created - there are two main ways to do this:\n\n- Using the [Templater] library, template tags can be added to files which are executed on creation. The plugin can be combined with [frontmatter] properties and used to generate content on the page such as dates, answers to user prompts and custom functions.\n\n- Using the [Dataview] library with both frontmatter and the variables described above allows for the creation of additional data views that can be used to drive dashboards.","lastmodified":"2022-07-02T12:11:47.396632344Z","tags":null},"/-gardening-tips/-obsidian/-plugins-theme":{"title":"🔌 Plugins \u0026 🌈 Theme","content":"%%\nStatus:: #done \n%%\n\n---\n**Tags**:: #theme #plugins #obsidian #customising #community \n\n---\n\n## Theme\n\nCurrently the [Obsidian Garden] uses an unmodified version of [Pisum](https://github.com/GuangluWu/obsidian-pisum) - a dark mode theme for [Obsidian].\n\n## Plugins\n\nTo make [Obsidian Garden] work there are a few core and community plugins that need to be enabled\n\n| Core            | Community               |\n| --------------- | ----------------------- |\n| Audio Recorder  | Advanced Tables         |\n| Backlinks       | Calendar                |\n| Command Pallete | Daily Stats             |\n| File Explorer   | Dataview                |\n| File Recovery   | Editor Syntax Highlight |\n| Graph View      | File Tree Alternative   |\n| Outgoing Links  | Focus Mode              |\n| Outline         | Gist                    |\n| Preview Pane    | Journey                 |\n| Quick Switcher  | Kanban                  |\n| Tag Pane        | Obsidian Git            |\n| Starred         | Periodic Notes          |\n| Search          | Reading Time            |\n| Word Count      | Search On Internet      |\n|                 | Templater               |\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-07-02T12:11:47.396632344Z","tags":null},"/-gardening-tips/-sowing-your-garden/-create-custom-dashboards":{"title":"🎯  Create Custom Dashboards","content":"\n## Custom dashboards with dataview\nThe [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) plugin for [📇 Terms/🪨 Obsidian/🪨 Obsidian] allows for the creation of 3 basic types of view using a SQL-like language, as well as JavaScript functions too.\n\nFull documentation is available on the site, but to help you along here are some basic examples - if you see the `dataview` code, switch to preview mode.\n\n### Last 5 edited files\nUsing the `file` object you can query properties and use functions to do things like date comparsion:\n```dataview\nlist file.mtime\nwhere file.mtime \u003c (date(today) + dur(1 day))\nsort file.mtime DESC\nlimit 5\n```\n\n### Show all tutorials\nYou can be more specific with queries, for example lets find all the pages that contain the `tutorial` type in [Front Matter]:\n```dataview\nlist where type = \"tutorial\"\n```\n\n### Show all 🌱 Seed templates\nAs well as lists, you can also render tables - when doing this, you can use file and [📇 Terms/🪨 Obsidian/Front Matter] properties and provide them a label.\n\nQuerying can be done in a specific folder\n```dataview\ntable description as \"Description\"\nfrom \"⏣ Templates\"\nsort file.name ASC\n```\n\n### People table\nAs well as folders we can also query `#tags` - when doing this it's good to exclude template files from the query\n```dataview\ntable connection as \"Connection\"\nfrom #person\nsort file.name ASC\nwhere file.name != \"👤 New Person\"\n```","lastmodified":"2022-07-02T12:11:47.396632344Z","tags":null},"/-gardening-tips/-sowing-your-garden/-planting-seeds":{"title":"🌱 Planting Seeds","content":"Tags:: #tutorials #seed #triage #tags #templates #statuses\n\n\u003e[👨🏻‍🌾 Bob]\n\u003eSo you want to learn the art of [🌳 Digital Gardening]?

Scientists, philosophers, writers, and even you and [I] try to categorise it, understand how it works and create [systems] that allow us to store and process this knowledge.\n\nEach time this has allowed new ideas to form, adding to the collective [Knowledge Graph] from which more build on - but in our modern world there are so many distractions and so much new information to process that it can be really hard to see the [links] between things.\n\nFrom our own minds, to a collection of half-filled notebooks in a drawer and from a bookshelf of unread books to your nearest library - all contain the inspiration we need to think of our next great idea.\n\n## 💩 Avoiding Information Rot\n\n⛔️ When it come to storing our ideas - in the worst-case we use only our brain.\n\nWhen we do this, an idea can only exist within the boundaries of our own imagination. No one else yet knows about your idea (unless there is a [Multiple Discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_discovery) - but this also means you're losing out).\n\nWithout communicating this idea the first real risk in [Information Rot] is you!\n\nIn the west, oral tradition is unreliable - telling people about your idea is great, but passed on information tends to be unreliable and incomplete. Only the source is truly reliable, and even then at risk of forgetting details.\n\nThe only way to truly capture an idea is to write it down, draw it, or record it. Even here there's a risk that without one single place to put it all - you will miss out on [connecting] it all together.\n\nIn [Knowledge Management] systems there is concept of the _\"second brain\"_ - a dynamic and visual hard drive that we can consciously put our stream of thoughts and ideas in to.\n\nOn top of this we build the [📇 Terms/🧠 Knowledge Systems/🌳 Digital Garden] idea - in this guide known as the **Knowledge Garden** - this is not a new idea, instead we build on this concept and use it as a base template to show a working system.\n\n## 🧠 Creating a second brain\n\nUsing [Obsidian] and this guide you can use it to create your own system - either by extending, or creating your own from scratch.\n\nBy extending Obsidian with [🔌 Plugins and a 🌈 Theme] we can start to build with more functionality for creating and querying the underlying data.\n\nThis guide is designed to get you starting in understanding why a [Knowledge Garden] is useful and to help reduce the learning curve.\n\n## 🌺 Letting Ideas Flourish\n\n⏳ Like a real garden, good ideas need nurtured and take time to grow - but can reap rewards when cared for correctly.\n\nTo escape the distractions of life we can visit our [Obsidian Garden|Knowledge Garden] to reconnect with [🌱 new] and [🪴 old](-grow-room.md) knowledge and create [links] between them so we can see the [Knowledge Graph] that connects them.\n\nAdding enhanced richness with `#tags` and `Variables::` allows us to perform [searches] and [build queries] that allow us to [🎯 Create Custom Dashboards] and code blocks that let us see through the overgrowth of all the data - display tables, and lists - both basic to do items.\n\nEvery [person's](-people.md) garden is different - some are neatly manecured and ordered, while some are more organic and wild - both need nurturing and tending too.\n\n### 🏄‍♂️ Suggested flow\n\nThe suggested flow shows one way of thinking how items are handled - when you have an idea (or want to collect a link, a picture of a doodle, create a contact) you can start with a [⏣ Templates/🗒 Basic Note] - or select a more detailed ⏣ Template.\n\nAll items start in the 🌱 Seed Box - an inbox for all items that need [triage].  Items can then go into the immediate 🪵 Backlog, or be categorised and filed - once items have been created they create new opportunities for new ideas to be created.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n\tIdea((Get Idea)) -- Braindump --\u003e Notes([Create Seeds])\n\tNotes --\u003e Triage{Triage}\n\tTriage --\u003e Dump\n\tTriage --\u003e Backlog\n\tBacklog --\u003e Dump\n\tBacklog --\u003e Organise\n\tTriage --\u003e Organise{{Organise Items}}\n\tOrganise -- Create --\u003e Person\n\tPerson --\u003e Research\u003eConduct Research]\n\tOrganise -- Create --\u003e Term\n\tTerm --\u003e Research\n\tOrganise -- Create --\u003e Todo\n\tTodo -- Discover --\u003e Idea\n\tResearch -- Question --\u003e Person\n\tResearch -- Discover --\u003e Idea\n\tResearch -- Formulate --\u003e Create\n\tCreate -- Iterate --\u003e Idea\n```\n\n---\n\n\u003e ✅ This set of tools is released under Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal [LICENSE](license.md)\n\n\u003e If you are looking for a more fully featured [Knowledge Management] system check out [LytKit](https://publish.obsidian.md/lyt-kit/_Start+Here)\n\n---\n\n%%\nOnce you're ready, feel free to change this readme and turn it into your home dashboard.\n%%\n\n## 🪵 Current Backlog\n\n```dataview\ntable file.ctime as \"Planted at\" \nfrom \"🪵 Backlog\"\nsort file.ctime DESC\n```\n\n## 🌱 Seed Box Latest 5\n\n```dataview\ntable file.ctime as \"Planted at\" \nfrom \"🌱 Seed Box\"\nsort file.ctime DESC\nlimit 5\n```\n\n## 5️⃣ Last 5 Files Edited\n\n```dataview\ntable file.mtime as \"Last tended to\"\nwhere file.mtime \u003c (date(today) + dur(1 day))\nsort file.mtime DESC\nlimit 5\n```\n","lastmodified":"2022-07-02T12:11:47.396632344Z","tags":null},"/changelog":{"title":"CHANGELOG","content":"## [Unreleased]\n\n### Changed\n- Moved important query variables to `Value::` properties instead of [frontmatter].\n\n## [0.0.0] - 2021-06-13\n\nInitial public release of the [👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/🪨  🌳  Obsidian Garden] - a toolset for knowledge collection, creating connections and nurturing ideas.\n\nIn this initial release there is some basic documentation on use, some basic dashboards and a starter struture with templates.\n\nExpect a lot of digging in the garden in the next few days!","lastmodified":"2022-07-02T12:11:47.396632344Z","tags":null},"/license":{"title":"LICENSE","content":"Creative Commons Legal Code\n\nCC0 1.0 Universal\n\n    CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE\n    LEGAL SERVICES.
